# Feature Branches, Commits, & Pull Requests

This book is a proposal for how we, as a community, structure how we integrate
code into an existing codebase.

The three components of integrating an improvement, bug fix, or new feature into
a codebase are a feature branch, some number of commits, and a pull request.
Between them all is a binding tie, 'git composite flow', which is a slight riff
on *git flow* and *GitHub flow*.

This document is not intended to be a prescription; it is intended to be a
proposal spec for, and an ask of a uniform conformity to a more structured
process when developing code as a team.
