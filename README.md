# Feature Branches, Commits, & Pull Requests

This book is a proposal for how we, as a community, structure how we integrate
code into an existing codebase.

The three components of integrating an improvement, bug fix, or new feature into
a codebase are feature branches, commits, and pull requests. The unifying tie
between them all is what I'm calling 'git composite flow' which is an extension
of git flow.

This document is not intended to be a prescription; it is intended to be a
proposal spec for, and an ask of a uniform conformity to a more structured
process when developing code as a team.
