#Recap: The Anatomy of a Good Commit Message
When thinking about writing a commit message, remember to follow these
guidelines for a happy team and a happy log!

###Your commit message subject line should
* Begin with a capital letter
* Not end with a period
* Be fewer than 50 characters in length
* Address, as specifically as possible, the change being made
* Use the imperative voice

###Your commit message body 
* Is separated from the subject line by a blank line
* Is wrapped to 72 columns to eliminate horizontal scrolling
* May contain a bulleted list
* Should explain *what* changes were made, and *why* they were made, as opposed to *how*
