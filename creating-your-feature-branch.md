#Creating Your Feature Branch
Alright, you've got your name all picked out, you have a clear purpose, now
let's get to the easiest part of this whole section: actually creating your
branch.

1) Always make sure you are on your stable development branch, and that it is up-to-date.

    $ git checkout <stable-development-branch>
    $ git pull origin <stable-development-branch>

2) Using the name you chose, create your branch.

    $ git checkout -b <my-stellar-feature-branch-name>

3) You're done.
