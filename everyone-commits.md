#Everyone Commits

Anyone who has ever used a source control system has made a commit; it's the
smallest unit of measurement available to a developer contributing to a project.
What is often overlooked, however, is how important this simple element of
source control is for long-term maintenance and individual contributions to
larger, team projects.

###Commits promote maintenance
It is undisputable. If you can't maintain a codebase, it will shrivel up and die
the kind of death only a codebase can: rapid-onset obsolescence in the face of an
ever-changing tech landscape.

**The quickest shortcuts to effective long-term maintenance of a codebase are history and context.**

#####What do we have without history and context?
We have blinders to choices made. We have no point of reference for future
choices. "I will implement a router!" Unfortunate that a router was already implemented.

Without context, we don't know why changes or additions were made. Consider a
developer who has freshly come on to a project. Without understanding of why
certain design choices were made, two choices for action emerge:

1. Read through (and hopefully understand) every code file efore making any changes
2. Make general assumptions on design choices, and hope future decisions have nt
   already been ruled out for good reason.

Context provides the solutions to these problems in short order. Good context
includes and explains history. Indeed, with good context comes good decision making.
