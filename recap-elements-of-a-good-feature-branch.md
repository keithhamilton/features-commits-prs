#Recap: The Elements of a Good Feature Branch
A good way to ensure you are creating concise, purposeful, and
logically-separated feature branches, is to check your feature branch against
the following questions:

* Does this feature branch address a feature, bug fix, hot fix, refactoring, or
  an experiment?
* Does the name I've chosen for it use the template found in
  [*Picking a Name*](picking-a-name.md)?
* Does the branch I'm ready to create address one logically-separated feature?
* Did I create my feature branch from the stable development branch?

If you answered no to any of the above, try to reposition your branch to answer
yes to all of them. This will lead to more efficient code integration, and will
help to keep your code clear of merge conflicts.
