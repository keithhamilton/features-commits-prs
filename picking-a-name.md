#Picking a Name
Your parents probably spent hours picking your name, and now that you have a
name, it's generally very simple for anyone who knows it to identify exactly who is being
identified by that name. There is little uncertainty, that if someone in my
office calls for *Keith Hamilton* that there will be any ambiguity as to whom
that person is addressing.

Your feature branches, like your own, or your parents', children, should have names that
specifically identify them as well. Like your surname, your feature branches
should also directly identify their parent.

#####The first term in a feature branch should be its author's initials.
